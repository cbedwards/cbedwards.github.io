I’m a theoretical ecologist and environmental data scientist; I like to dive into computational and statistical methods, and explore the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind community assembly, phenology, and plant defense strategies. Here you can find out more about me, my research explained for academics or for a general audience, as well as use tutorials and resources I’ve developed for working in ecology and evolutionary biology."
